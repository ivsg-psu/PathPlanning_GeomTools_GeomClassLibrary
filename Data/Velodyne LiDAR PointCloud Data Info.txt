Velodyne LiDAR PointCloud Data Info

Written by: Xinyu Cao

Velodyne PointCloud data was parsed from ROS message /velodyne_packets with the velodyne-decoder library.
The decoded point clouds are provided either as a structured NumPy array.

Array details:
Column 1: x [m] - The x coord in Cartesian coordinates
Column 2: y [m] - The y coord in Cartesian coordinates
Column 3: z [m] - The z coord in Cartesian coordinates
Column 4: intensity - The measured intensity at the point
Column 5: ring - The ring number of the laser
Column 6: time - The time stamp of the measured point (The unit of the time still need to be checked)
