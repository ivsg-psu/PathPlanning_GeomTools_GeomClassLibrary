%% fcn_geometry_createHistogram
% Create a histogram that shows points per grid
% 
% FORMAT:
%
%      [point_density] = fcn_geometry_createHistogram(total_points_in_each_grid_in_the_driven_path, fig_histogram)
%
% INPUTS:     
%       
%      total_points_in_each_grid_in_the_driven_path: The total points in
%      each grid of the driven path of the mapping van
%
%      fig_histogram: the figure number of the histogram, (this is
%      mandatory input because the purpose of this function is to show
%      histogram plot).
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       
%      point_density: the density of point in each grid
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
%      (none)
