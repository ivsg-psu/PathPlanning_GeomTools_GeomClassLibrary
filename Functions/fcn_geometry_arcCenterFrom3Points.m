% Calculating the center of an arc
%
% 1- Find any two chords of the circle - Calculate the distance between two
% point pairs.
% 2- Find the mid-point of the two-point pairs.
% 3- Find the perpendicular bisector of those two chords.
% 4-The intersection of those two perpendicular bisectors is the center of
% the circle.
%
% These formulas are derived based on the geometric properties mentioned
% above.
