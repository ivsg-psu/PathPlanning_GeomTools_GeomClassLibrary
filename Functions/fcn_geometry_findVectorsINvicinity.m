function [vectorsCloseTOref, SameDirection_vectorsCloseTOref] = fcn_geometry_findVectorsINvicinity(inputVectors, refVector, tolerance)
% fcn_findVectorsINvicinity
%
% Finds the vectors that are in the vicinity of the reference vector and
% are in the same direction of the reference vector
%
% FORMAT: 
% 
% [vectorsCloseTOref, SameDirection_vectorsCloseTOref] = fcn_findVectorsINvicinity(inputVectors, refVector, tolerance)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   inputVectors: a list of Nxm vector where N is the number of vectors,
%   and m is the dimension of the vector (typically 2 or 3).
%
%   refVector: this is the vector that is used as a reference to check if
%   an input vector is in the vicinity or not.
%
%   tolerance: this is the tolerance limit to determine if a vector is in
%   the vicinity of the reference vector or not. Here, the euclidean
%   distance of the unit vectors of input vectors and the unit vector of
%   reference vector is computed. If the distance is less than tolerance
%   limit, the input vector is considered to be in the vicinity of the
%   reference vector.
% 
% (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%
% OUTPUTS: 
%  
%   vectorsCloseTOref: the vectors that are in the vicinity of the
%   reference vector are calculated
%
%   SameDirection_vectorsCloseTOref: the vectors that are in the vicinity
%   and are in the same direction of the reference vector are computed
%
