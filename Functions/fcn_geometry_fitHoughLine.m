function [fitted_parameters, agreement_indicies] = fcn_geometry_fitHoughLine(points, transverse_tolerance, station_tolerance, varargin)
% fcn_geometry_fitHoughLine
% Finds all permutations between points to fit a line (N choose 2),
% calculates the line fit in polar form (rho and phi), and determines which
% of the points are within a tolerance distance of that line fit. This is
% calculated for all possible 2-point permutations, ordered in N-choose-2
% format.
%
% Format: 
% [fitted_parameters, agreement_indicies] = fcn_geometry_fitHoughLine(points,varargin)
%
% INPUTS:
%      points: a Nx2 vector where N is the number of points, but at least 2 rows. 
%
%      transverse_tolerance: the orthogonal distance between the points and
%      the linear curve fit that indicate whether a point "belongs" to the
%      fit (if distance is less than or equal to the tolerance), or is
%      "outside" the fit (if distance is greater than the tolerance).
%
%      station_tolerance: the projection distance between the points in a
%      curve fit, along the direction of the line, that indicate whether a
%      point "belongs" to the linear fit (if distance is less than or equal
%      to the tolerance), or is "outside" the fit (if distance is greater
%      than the tolerance).
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
% 
%      fig_num: a figure number to plot the results.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%      Let K represent the number of permutations possible in N-choose-2
%      standard ordering (see function nchoosek). For each K value, this
%      returns:
%
%      fitted_parameters: the angle, phi, and radius, rho, for the line
%      fitting two points in the point permutation. This is returned as a
%      [K x 2] matrix ordered as [phi rho]. The line fit is of the form:
%      r = rho / [cos(theta - phi)]
%
%      agreement_indicies: a row of 1 or 0 for all points, with 1
%      indicating that a given point is "within" the line projection, 0 if
%      not. This is returned as a [K x N] matrix.
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
