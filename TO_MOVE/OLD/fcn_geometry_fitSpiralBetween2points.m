function fittedSpiral = fcn_geometry_fitSpiralBetween2points(endPoint, startPoint, varargin)
% fcn_geometry_fitArc
%
% This function takes the end point of a/an straight line/arc and the start
% point of an/a arc/straight line as the input and outputs the fitted
% points of the Archimedean spiral. In short, this function fits an
% Archimedean spiral to the end point of a/an straight line/arc and start
% point of an arc/straight line
%
% METHOD
%
% STEP 1: Determine the angles of the end and start points
%
% STEP 2: Compute a (Initial distance) and b (Rate of growth) parameter by
% calculating the distances to the end and start points from the origin.
%
% STEP 3: Using a and b, fit an Archimedean spiral (a + b*theta) b/w the
% end and start points
%
%
% FORMAT:
%
%       fittedSpiral = fcn_geometry_fitSpiralBetween2points(endPoint, startPoint, varargin)
%
% INPUTS:
