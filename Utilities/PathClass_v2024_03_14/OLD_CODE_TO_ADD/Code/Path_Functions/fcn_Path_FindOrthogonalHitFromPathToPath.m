% fcn_Path_FindOrthogonalHitFromPathToPath
% Given a central traversal and a set of stations along that traversal,
% finds the location on a nearby traversal that is closest to the central
% traveral at each station point. Closest is defined via an orthogonal
% projection (or modifications of orthogonal projections) from the central
% traversal outward toward nearby traversals.

% FORMAT:

%        fcn_Path_FindOrthogonalHitFromPathToPath(...
%        stations,central_traversal,nearby_traversal,...
%        (flag_rounding_type),(search_radius),(fig_num));
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      stations: an N x 1 vector containing the station on the central
%      traversal where the projections should take place
%
%      central_traversal: a traversal structure that specifies the path
%      where projections to other paths are taking place.
%
%      nearby_traversal: a traversal structure that specifies the path
%      where intersections from the central_traversal would hit.
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%      flag_rounding_type: a flag to indicate which type of projection is
%      used, especially when stations are located at the end-points of
%      segments within the nearby_traversal. Note that the very first point
%      always uses projections from the following segement, and the very
%      last point always uses the prior. The flag determines behaviors for
%      endpoints of internal segments. The options include:
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 1;  % This is the default, and indicates that
%          the orthogonal projection of an endpoint is created by the PRIOR
%          segment leading up to each station query point.
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 2;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection of an endpoint is created by the FOLLOWING segment
%          after each station query point.
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 3;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection, ONLY if the station query falls at the joining point
%          between two segments (e.g. is on the "joint"), then the
%          projection is created by averaging the vector projections
%          created from the PRIOR segment and FOLLOWING segment.
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 4;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projections along segments should be calculated at the midpoints
%          of each segment, and then for each station qeuary, the vector
%          projections are interpolated from their prior and subsequent
%          vectors.
%
%      search_radius: how far nearby the search points to look (default is
%      3 times the length of the station in the central_trajectory)
%
%      fig_num: a figure number to plot results.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      closest_path_point: a 1x2 vector containing the [X Y] location of
%      the nearest point on the path
%      s_coordinate: a scalar (1x1) representing the s-coordinate distance
%      along the path

% Revision history:
%     2020_11_14:
%     -- first write of the code
%     2020_12_25:
%     -- changed plot style for situation where query overlaps the central
%     path (so have different line styles)
%     -- fixed a bug where the index was being used, instead of station, to
%     define a search area
%     -- isolated plotting functionality from debugging functionality

% TO DO:
% Define search radius - need to let user define this as an input!

flag_do_debug = 0; % Flag to debug the results
flag_do_plot = 0; % Flag to plot the results
flag_check_inputs = 1; % Flag to perform input checking
